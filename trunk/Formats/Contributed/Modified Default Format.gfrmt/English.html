<p>The &quot;Default Format&quot; is a full-featured format provided with <b>GEDitCOM II</b>. It is designed to have a robust set of editing tools that allow you to edit all features supported in the GEDCOM genealogy file standard. Since the &quot;Default Format&quot; is provided with <b>GEDitCOM II</b> and the first format that loads, many of its features are already documented in the main <b>GEDitCOM II</b> help.</p>

<p>Each type of record (<i>e.g.</i>, Individual, Families, <i>etc.</i>) opens in a display customized for that type of record. Since Individual and Family records often have much information, the various sections of those records are divided into &quot;panes.&quot; Select the section you want to view and edit by using the button bar at the top of the window. All other records display in a single pane. To see individual and family records all in a single pane too, you can select the &quot;All&quot; pane or you can switch to the &quot;Default One Pane Format.&quot;</p>

<p>The sections below list the preferences that can be set for the &quot;Default Format&quot; and explain the functions of the icons;. The following is an index to those topics:

</p>

<dl>
<dt>Name Editing Fields</dt>
<dd>Control click to change the case of the name (<i>e.g.</i>, to all uppercase, title case, or surname only in uppercase).</dd>

<dt>.ged Button</dt>
<dd>Click this button to share the ancestors or descendants of the current individual with friends and relatives through a GEDCOM file (if they do not have GEDitCOM II). Send them the file created by following the steps in this script.</dd>

</dl>

<h2><a name="fonts"></a>Format Fonts</h2>

<p>To change format-specific fonts, open the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences window and click on the &quot;Fonts&quot; tab. The &quot;Default Format's&quot; fonts are:

<dt>GEDCOM Extension Text</dt>
<dd>The &quot;Default Format&quot; allows some extensions to GEDCOM 5.5. As long as you are using <b>GEDitCOM II</b>, those extension will always work fine. If the export to another program, the extensions will exported, but the other program will probably not recognize the data is may even delete it. To help you recognize GEDCOM extensions, these labels are indicated in this font. The custom tags are mostly in Source and Multimedia Object records.
</dd>

</dl>

<h2><a name="colors"></a>Format Colors</h2>

<p>To change format-specific colors, open the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences window and click on the &quot;Colors&quot; tab. The &quot;Default Format's&quot; colors are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Window Background</dt>
<dd>The main color for the background of a browser window.</dd>

<dt>Record Header Box Background</dt>
<dd>The top section of the window background in a browser window uses this color rather than the main window background color.</dd>

<dt>Editing Background</dt>
<dd>The background for cells used for text editing.</dd>

<dt>Table Cell Background</dt>
<dd>The background for header cells used in tables of data.</dd>

</dl>


<h2><a name="variables"></a>Format-Specific Variables</h2>

<p>To change format-specific variables, open the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences window and click on the &quot;Editing&quot; tab. The margin settings and default settings are common to all formats. The variables specific to the &quot;Default Format&quot; are:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Multimedia Full Size</dt>
<dd>Images in multimedia records will display at the full size of the image in the file (which can be scaled using the scale menu). The larger dimension of the image, however, will never exceed the window width or this &quot;Multimedia Full Size&quot; setting, whichever is smaller. You can use the &quot;Zoom&quot; pane view the image at a scale larger than the window (as set with the scale menu).
</dd>

<dt>Thumbnails Per Row</dt>
<dd>Links for records to multimedia objects are displayed with a thumbnail image to the object. This preference sets the number of thumbnails per row in the display. The thumbnails will also adjust in size if the window size is changed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spped up display of thumbnails, GEDitCOM II generates small thumbnails for each multimedia object containing an image. These thumbnails look fine when the links are small. If the links get large (<i>e.g.</i>, when using one thumbnail per row), this format will use the full scale image rather than the internal thumbnails. The image quality will be good, but it might slow down access to records with lots of linked images. To maximize speed when opening such records, it is best to increase this setting to at least 2 and you may need 3 or more if using a large monitor with large record windows.
</dd>

<dt>Notes Position</dt>
<dd>A numeric code for location of the editing pane in Notes records. The options are: 1 = left, 2 = top, 3 = right, and 4 = bottom.
</dd>

</dl>

<h1><a name="mods"></a>Modifications to Default Format</h1>

<p>This format was modifed from the standard &quot;Default Format&quot; by Simon Robbins. The following sections summarize the changes:</p>

<h2>Individual Window</h2>

<ol>
<li>Changed Events and All tabs so that event and attribute lists shows place detail rather than in child window (requires changes to INDI_Events and INDI_All record templates to change tab settings. Also EventDetails record editing template to change place detail in child window to static text. Event Editing template changed to amend column headings, and PLAC Editing also changed to format place data correctly.) <font color="red">As of version 1.7 similar changes have been made to the default format although this modified version also affects attributes which the default format does not.</font>
</li>

<li>Copied the main pedigree format window for an individual into a new tab in this format. Much of the pedigree format duplicates the functionality of the 
default format, but I find this screen particularly useful for navigating a file as it shows 4 generations at once. It can now be used without switching formats. <font color="red">As of version 1.7 the default format does this as well although there are sill a few formatting differences.</font></li>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Family Window</h2>

<ol>
<li>FAM_Events and FAM_All have changes to tab setting in line with changes to INDI templates to show place detail in main window.</li>
<li>Baptism and death dates added to children table. (requires changes to FAM and FAM_All Record editing templates to change tab settings. Also CHIL editing template to change column headings and display thedata) <font color="red">As of version 1.7 death dates are now in the default format.</font></li>
</ol>

<h2>Multimedia Window</h2>

<ol>
<li>Remove Geographical Data (Lat, Long, Location) and keywords from multimedia tab. <font color="red">This is now the default as of version 1.7</font></li>
<li>Add Geographical Data (Lat, Long, Location) and keywords to other tab. <font color="red">This is now the default as of version 1.7</font></li>
<li>Removed scaling from zoom tab ( OBJEPanes subroutine) so that picture always fills available width.</li>
<li>Removed scaling from main multimedia tab so image shown at maximum size within space available (does not always work for images at more than 72dpi, need to investigate)</li>
<li>Changed the main multimedia tab to enable the display of certain types of video & audio multimedia
using the html capabilities of GEDitCOM and avoiding the need to open the file in a helper application.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Notes Window</h2>

<ol>
<li>Added Panes to note editing window. Also needs change to CONC Editing template</li>
</ol>

<h2>Research Log Window</h2>

<ol>
<li>Added Panes to Research Log editing window. <font color="red">Now part of default since 1.7</font></li>
</ol>
 
<h2>Record Templates</h2>

<ol>
<li>Added URL to REPO Record Editing Template. <font color="red">As of 1.4 included in default</font></li>
<li>Added various bits to TaskComments Record Editing Template to enable links to INDI and FAM records. Also needs slight change to _RESULTS Tag editing template.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tag Templates</h2>

<ol>
<li>Increased height of field in ADDR Editing Template for 5 line addresses</li>
<li>Changed _SUMMARY Editing template to handle summary differently in summary tab of Research Log editing window.</li>
<li>Changed CHIL Editing template to include baptism and death details in Family record. Also needs change to setting of tabs in FAM and FAM_All record editing templates</li>
<li>NOTES template edited to suppress display of html note in other linked records when there is a table in the note and to show link instead</li>
<li>FAMS, FAMC, HUSB and WIFE templates changed to included dates next to each name and the "+" used to show ancestor or descendant details has changed to upwards or downwards pointing arrows.</li>
<li>FAMS template changed to create a bit more space between each family than between members of the same family to aid visual identification. Also children indented a bit for the same reason.</li>
<li>AGE template modified to make an age field smaller and add a calculated age where possible. I use the age field to record the age quoted at the time of the event which is not necessarily the true age of the individual at that point. (Note: this will still be shown even if the date of birth recorded is only an estimate or the result of a calculation based on ther events so may not be entirely accurate itself.)</li>

</ol>


<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p><font color="red">NOTE:</font> Some of these add or modify data and whilst they have been tested are used at your own risk.</p>

<ol>
<li>Incorporated Census cross referencing script. When viewing census detail, button available to run report showing other family members in the same census entry (provided they are in the database with the same reference details)</li>
<li>When viewing an individual with no date of birth a button will be available to try and calculate one. Looks at all events for the individual and in linked families and calculates an average date of birth based on event dates and ages. 
(only works where age is an integer in years as there are many ways to enter 3m 3mths 3months etc. so difficult to calculate. Also will only return calculated average if this is earlier than the earliest event, otherwise will default to year of earliest event. This is mainly to avoid calculating a date which is after a known baptism.) 
This button will also appear if a date has previously been calculated to enable recalculation when new events are added. </li>
<li>A script has been added to enable a list of sources to be sorted by date if available, or by name if not. The icon at the start of a list of sources has been changed and now invokes this script rather than the old behaviour of adding a new source. New sources may still be attached using the button in the attach section</li>
<li>Events tab in Individual and family windows now have buttons to copy and paste events so that similar events may be entered more quickly</li>
<li>Where sources are appropriate the are now buttons to copy and paste so that similar sources may be entered more quickly</li>
<li>A couple of scripts have been added to switch on and off the display of certain types of 
video & audio multimedia to support the change listed above for the multimedia window.</li>

</ol>

<p>The scripts which copy and paste events and sources need Pashua to be installed. Pashua is a small application which enables more sophisticated dialog boxes to be used in scripts and can also be used with Python and Ruby. It enables multiple text fields, multi line text fields, radio buttons, check boxes, drop down menus and other controls not available in plain applescript. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/pashua/">http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/pashua/</a>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Some new icons have been added for some of the scripts</p>

<ul>

<li><img src = "images/AppProIcon.tiff"/ WIDTH="40"> - Used in Pashua dialogs.
<li><img src = "images/NoFile.tiff"/ WIDTH="40"> - Used in dialogs where image cannot be found or is a type which cannot be displayed.
<li><img src = "images/SortSource.tiff" /> - Sort sources into date/name order.
</ul>

<p>There are a few other icons in the format which were tested but are not currently used. They have been left in case they are useful in future.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<ol>
<li>Changed maximum height of SourceDetails and SourceContent Record editing windows to 650</li>
<li>Added Events:
<ul>
<li>EVEN7	Accident
<li>EVEN8	Trial
<li>EVEN9	Decoration
</ul></li>
</ol>
