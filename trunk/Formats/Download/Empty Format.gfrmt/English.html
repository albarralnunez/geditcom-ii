<p>This is format has the minimum templates to run as a format. It could be used as a starting point for writing an entirely new type of format for <b>GEDitCOM II</b> using the <b>GEDitCOM Editor</b>. As is, all formatting is done by the default templates (the &quot;_Unknown_ Record Editing&quot; for records and the &quot;_Unknown Editing&quot; for all subordinate structures). These templates simply display the raw GEDCOM data with line levels indented for clarity.
</p>

<p>Others things included in this format are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>All required editing colors, fonts, and properties.</li>

<li>A complete set of GEDCOM events and attributes for individuals and families. These lists include a few common custom evens using <code>EVEN#</code> tags.
</li>

<li>A common set of language keys for English strings including keys for all GEDCOM tags and records.
</li>

<li>This simple documentation page linked to a <code>help.css</code> style sheet file that matches the help style used in <b>GEDitCOM II</b>.
</li>

</ol>
