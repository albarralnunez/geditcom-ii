<p>This format displays the text is a very printer friendly way. You can edit many parts of the data, but it has fewer editing options than the &quot;Default Format&quot;.
</p>

<p>All data is loaded into a single window without the use of child windows. In fact even linked data (such as notes and multimedia objects) are all loaded into the same window as well. While this approach is desireable for printing the entire content of records, it can result in long displays. In very long records, you may even notice a delay while all the data is formatted for display.
</p>

<h2>Book Format Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>Although there do not appear to be any editing fields, much of the text can be edited. Click the mouse in any text to see if editing is allowed. If you get a flashing cursor, you can edit the text.</li>

<li>You can drag and drop records on records to attach data as explained in the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> help.
</li>

<li>You change the format's fonts and colors using the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences.
</li>

<li>The custom options in the &quot;Editing&quot; section of the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences are:

<ul>

<li><b>Hang Indent</b>: Set the left margin for the section labels within each record.
</li>

<li><b>Left Margin</b>: Sets the margin for text under the section labels and it is independen of the <b>Hang Indent</b> setting.
</li>

<li><b>Level Indentation</b>: Subordinate data is indented further from the root level data. Use this setting to select the indentation per level.
</li>

<li><b>Multimedia Full Size</b>: Set the maximum height for multimedia objects. Multimedia objects will always be scaled (if needed) to fit in the display area, but can be ruther limited to this size.
</li>

</ul>

</ul>
