<body><h1>Pedigree Format</h1>

<p>The &quot;Pedigree Format&quot; displays each individual as a four-generation pedigree chart (individual up to grandparents; hint: you can resize the individual window to display the entire chart and that size will be remembered). You can click on links in this view to quickly navigate around the genealogy data in your file:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on any chart cell to view the pedigree chart for that individual (note: a line to the right of any grandparent means additional ancestors are documented; the lack of a line means no more ancestors are known).
<li>Click on any family icon  button to view a family group chart for the spouses above and below the button.
<li>To see descendants, click on any name in the list of &quot;Children.&quot; (note: a &quot;+&quot; in front of any child means additional descendants of that child are documented; the lack of a plus means that child has no documented children).
<li>If the individual had more than one marriage, you click click on names in the &quot;Other Spouses/Children&quot; list (note: a &quot;+&quot; in front of any other child means additional descendants of that child are documented; the lack of a plus means that child has no documented children).
</ol>

<p>You cannot edit the pedigree chart. Instead, to edit all the details on an individual click various tabs in the button bar at the top of the window for &quot;Events,&quot; &quot;Multimedia,&quot; and &quot;Other.&quot; While most things can be edited, a few options in the &quot;Default Format&quot; are not available. You can alway switch back to the &quot;Default Format&quot; for any editing needs not found in the &quot;Pedigree Format.&quot;
</p>

<p>Besides individual records, other record editing options are:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Family Records</b>: These records will show as a concise family group chart. You can edit marriage date and place and attach or detach children. To edit more family details, click the &quot;Events and Others&quot; or &quot;Multimedia&quot; tabs at the top of the window. To edit more marriage details, open the &quot;Events and Others&quot; section and click the &quot;info&quot; icon after the marriage event.

<li><b>Other Records</b>: All other records are edited by methods similar to the &quot;Default Format&quot; and mostly documented in the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> help. The colors and fonts, however, use the style of the &quot;Pedigree Format.&quot;

</ul>

<h2><a name="colors"></a>Format Colors</h2>

<p>To change format-specific colors, open the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences window and click on the &quot;Colors&quot; tab. The &quot;Pedigree Format's&quot; colors are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Window Background</dt>
<dd>The main color for the background of a browser window.</dd>

<dt>Record Header Box Background</dt>
<dd>The top section of the window background in a browser window uses this color rather than the main window background color.</dd>

<dt>Editing Background</dt>

<dt>Table Cell Background</dt>
<dd>The background for header cells used in tables of data.</dd>

<dt>Main Individual Background</dt>

</dd>

<dt>Family Chart Background</dt>
<dd>The background color for family charts. This color is ignored when printing, which will use white background instead.
</dd>

</dl>


<h2><a name="variables"></a>Format-Specific Variables</h2>

<p>To change format-specific variables, open the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences window and click on the &quot;Editing&quot; tab. The margin settings and default settings are common to all formats. The variables specific to the &quot;Pedigree Format&quot; are:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Multimedia Full Size</dt>
<dd>Images in multimedia records will display at the full size of the image in the file (which can be scaled using the scale menu). The larger dimension of the image, however, will never exceed the window width or this &quot;Multimedia Full Size&quot; setting, whichever is smaller. You can use the &quot;Zoom&quot; pane view the image at a scale larger than the window (as set with the scale menu).
</dd>

<dt>Thumbnails Per Row</dt>
<dd>Links for records to multimedia objects are displayed with a thumbnail image to the object. This preference sets the number of thumbnails per row in the display. The thumbnails will also adjust in size if the window size is changed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spped up display of thumbnails, GEDitCOM II generates small thumbnails for each multimedia object containing an image. These thumbnails look fine when the links are small. If the links get large (<i>e.g.</i>, when using one thumbnail per row), this format will use the full scale image rather than the internal thumbnails. The image quality will be good, but it might slow down access to records with lots of linked images. To maximize speed when opening such records, it is best to increase this setting to at least 2 and you may need 3 or more if using a large monitor with large record windows.
</dd>

<dt>Notes Position</dt>
<dd>A numeric code for location of the editing pane in Notes records. The options are: 1 = left, 2 = top, 3 = right, and 4 = bottom.
</dd>

<dt>Chart Box Width</dt>
<dd>The width of cells in the pedigree chart. Make it large enough for your longest names.
</dd>

<dt>Chart Box Width</dt>
<dd>The width of cells in the pedigree chart. Make it large enough for your longest names.
</dd>

<dt>Chart Column Spacing</dt>
<dd>The horizontal spacing between generations in the pedigree chart</dd>

<dt>Chart Row Spacing</dt>
<dd>The vertical spacing between spouses in the pedigree chart</dd>

<dt>Chart Box Padding</dt>
<dd>Extra padding within the cell in the horizontal direction</dd>

</dl>
