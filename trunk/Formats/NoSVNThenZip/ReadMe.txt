This folder is used to prepare formats for inclusion in GEDitCOM II by removing all SVN files from the format package. To remove then

1. Copy any format to this folder (a package ending in .gfrmt)
2. Run the RemoveSVNFiles script
3. Copy the resulting files to install locations

Do not move any of them back to the SVN folders, because they no longer have the SVN files needed for versioning.
