For each individual, you will see and can edit all parts of residence events, remove residences or add more residences. In addition, it will display all linked multimedia objects and notes. The options for using this format are:</p>

<h2>Using the Address Book Format</h2>

</ul>

<h3><a name="view"></a>Viewing Related Records</h3>

<p>Unlike the &quot;Default Format&quot; the &quot;Address Book&quot; format does not have any links to related records such as parents, spouses, children, and relevant family records. You can navigate to all these types or records, however, by using the menu commands in the &quot;View&quot; menu or by clicking the icons in the window's tool bar.</p>

<h3><a name="util"></a>Utilities</h3>

<p>This section has buttons that perform various functions:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Find Individuals with Residences</dt>
<dd>Goes through all individuals in the current file and moves all that have one or more residence events to an album (named &quot;Known Residences&quot; in English). You can go through the records in that album to see all residences in the file. If you rerun the file, it will reuse the same album (as long as the name was not changed) and add an new individual found that now have residences to that album.</dd>

<dt>Export vCard</dt>
<dd>Exports the current individual to a vCard. Select a file name ending with extension <code>.vcf</code> (if you forget the extension, it will be added for you) and the file will be created. Such cards can be input into many applications such as Apple's Address Book application. The card will have the person's name, birthdate (if known), portrait (if available), and details for all known residences. In addition, the first note about the individual will be included. To export multiple individuals to a single vCard file, select the records in the index window and use the &quot;Export vCards&quot; script (you can download this script from <a href="http://www.geditcom.com">geditcom.com</a>, or get it using the &quot;Download Script&quot; menu command, if you do not have it).</dd>

</dl>

<h3><a name="mmrec"></a>Editing Multimedia Object Records</h3>

<p>Multimedia objects will show the image (if possible) and list basic information about the object. To edit any object, click on the image in another record or click on the <font color="blue">&#x24D8;</font> icon next to a URL or email link. The editing options are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Change the image scaling using the pop-up menu. If the scaled image is wider than the window, it will be scaled to fit the window. The text to the right of the menu indicates the maximum scaling that will fit the current window size. You can choose &quot;fit&quot; to always scale the image to the window width.</li>

<li>You can click on the image itself to open the file in a helper application for additional editing. If the multimedia object is a URL or email address, you can click the Hypertext for the image to visit the web site of send an email.</li>

<h3><a name="noterec"></a>Editing Notes Records</h3>

<p>All notes are in separate note records. To edit any notes, click on the &quot;Edit&quot; button next to the notes. The records will open and the editing options are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Enter any amount of notes into the provided text-editing field.</li>

<li>By starting the text with &lt;div&gt; and ending it with &lt;/div&gt;, you can enter <code>html</code> code and the content will be rendered when viewed in the main records. See the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> help for details on using <code>html</code> content. For example, you can control click to get a pop-up menu with <code>html</code> editing options.</li>

<li>If notes are already using <code>html</code> content, the editing field will initial render the content for display. To edit the raw <code>html</code> text, use the &quot;Edit HTML Content&quot; menu command in the &quot;View&quot menu.</li>

<li>The Hypertext links at the top of the record show the individual records linked to the notes. You can click the link to see those records.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="famrecs"></a>Family Records</h3>

<p>You can open any family record. The top of the record will list the father and mother (or husband and wife) for the family group and their names will be links to their records. The &quot;Known Family Residences&quot; will show all known residences for any member of the family. These residences are read only. To edit them go to the individual record by clicking the link to that record at the start of each residence. You can, however, edit multimedia objects by clicking on the image or edit URL and email address by clicking on their <font color="blue">&#x24D8;</font> icon.</p>

<h3><a name="misc"></a>Editing Other Types of Records</h3>

<p>The Address Book format has only limited editing options focused on editing residences and individual records. You can view Family Records and edit Multimedia Object or Note Records. For all other types of records, however, nothing is shown and nothing can be edited. If you try to open such a record, you will get an message indicating it cannot be editing. YOu should switch to some other format, such as the &quot;Default Format&quot;, to edit those records.</li>

<h2><a name="prefs"></a>Address Book Properties (or Preferences)</h2>

<ul>

<li>You can change the Address Book's fonts (and their colors) using the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences. The available fonts are:
<ul>

<li><b>Section Label</b>: Text used for major sections of the displayed data.</li>

<li><b>Name Font</b>: The text used for displaying and editing the name field for each individual.</li>

<li><b>Static Text</b>: The text used for all labels and other text that cannot be edited.</li>

<li><b>Editing Text</b>: The text used in editing fields.</li>

<li><b>Button Text</b>: The text for buttons.</li>

<li><b>Check Box Text</b>: The text next to check boxes.</li>

<li><b>Popup Menu Text</b>: The text used in pop-up menus.</li>

<li><b>Hyperlink Text</b>: The text used for clickable links between records and for links to web sites or email addresses.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>You change the Address Book's colors using the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences.
The available colors are:

<ul>

<li><b>Lines Between Sections</b>: Color for horizontal lines drawn between sections.</li>

<li><b>Box Lines</b>: Color for border lines of the boxes drawn around residence information.</li>

<li><b>Window Background</b>: Background color of the window (white is best for printing).</li>

<li><b>Editing Background</b>: Background color of editing fields (matching the window background color is best for printing).</li>

<li>Font Colors: Each font described above can have it's own color and is set when editing the fonts.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The custom Address Book settings in the &quot;Editing&quot; section of the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences are:

<ul>

<li><b>Section Line Left Margin</b>: Set the left margin of the section labels, and specifically the distance from left edge of the window to the start of the horizontal lines draw between sections.
</li>

<li><b>Vertical Shift of Edit Field Labels</b>: Extra shift added to all labels before text editing fields. If you change fonts and the labels and the text fields do not line up well, adjust this value to realign them; positive shifts the label down while negative shifts it up.
</li>

<li><b>Vertical Shift of Button Labels</b>: Extra shift added to all labels before buttons and popup menus. If you change fonts and the labels and buttons do not line up well, adjust this value to realign them; positive shifts the label down while negative shifts it up.
</li>

<li><a name="tpr"></a><b>Thumbnails Per Row</b>: Linked multimedia objects are displayed as thumbnails in the linking record. This option determines the number of thumbnails per row in the display and thus can be used to control the size of the thumbnail images.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speed up display of thumbnails, GEDitCOM II generates small thumbnails for each multimedia object containing an image. These thumbnails look fine when the links are small. If the links get large (<i>e.g.</i>, when using one thumbnail per row), this format will use the full scale image rather than the internal thumbnails. The image quality will be good, but it might slow down access to records with lots of linked images. To maximize speed when opening such records, it is best to increase this setting to at least 2 and you may need 3 or more if using a large monitor with large record windows.
</li>

<li><b>Label Width</b>: The space reserved for text labels in front of editing fields (<i>i.e.</i>, the distance from left edge of the window to the colons after the labels). If a needed label does not fit with the allocated space, in the space is enlarged to accommodate the label. Thus if the columns do not line up, you can enlarge this setting until all labels fit. The preferred setting may depend on the language in use.</li>

</ul>
</ul>
