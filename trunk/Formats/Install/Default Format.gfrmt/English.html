<p>The &quot;Default Format&quot; is a full-featured format provided with <b>GEDitCOM II</b>. It is designed to have a robust set of editing tools that allow you to edit all features supported in the GEDCOM genealogy file standard. Since the &quot;Default Format&quot; is provided with <b>GEDitCOM II</b> and the first format that loads, many of its features are already documented in the main <b>GEDitCOM II</b> help.</p>

<p>Each type of record (<i>e.g.</i>, Individual, Families, <i>etc.</i>) opens in a display customized for that type of record. Some details on each record type are in the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#indi">Individual Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#fam">Family Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#_plc">Place Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#obje">Multimedia Object Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#note">Note Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#sour">Source Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#repo">Repository Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#book">Book Style Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#log">Research Log Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#head">Header, Submitter, and Submission Records</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These sections list the preferences that can be set for the &quot;Default Format&quot; and explain the functions of the icons:

<h2><a name="indi"></a>Individual Records</h2>

<p>Because Individual records often have much information, the various sections are divided into &quot;panes.&quot; Select the section you want see by using the button bar at the top of the window:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Individual</dt>
<dd>This pane has basic genealogy information such as name, birth and death details, links to parents, and links to spouses and children. The family icon button links to the associated family record. (Hint: you can control click on the name to change its case (<i>e.g.</i>, to all uppercase, title case, or surname only in uppercase.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow indicators after a parent or spouse mean that person has additional ancestors. An arrow indicator before a child means that child has their own children. An equal sign before a child means that child has a spouse, but no known children. (Hint: you can customize these indicators using in the <a href="#variables">preferences</a>.</dd>

<dt>Events</dt>
<dd>This pane list all events (including repeat of birth and death from the &quot;Individual&quot; pane). You can attach or detach events and enter their date and place. For attributes you can enter text about the attribute. To add more detail on any event, click the &quot;info&quot; icon and enter the data into the window that appears.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The green arrow sorts events by dates.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The &quot;Copy Event&quot; button will copy the event currently with the editing cursor. You can move to another record and use its &quot;Paste Event&quot; button to add that event to the second individual.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The &quot;Map&quot; button will map all events and attributes with known latitude and longitude (or place with known bounding box).

</dd>

</dl>

<h2><a name="colors"></a>Format Colors</h2>

<p>To change format-specific colors, open the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences window and click on the &quot;Colors&quot; tab. The &quot;Default Format's&quot; colors are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Window Background</dt>
<dd>The main color for the background of a browser window.</dd>

<dt>Record Header Box Background</dt>
<dd>The top section of the window background in a browser window uses this color rather than the main window background color.</dd>

<dt>Editing Background</dt>
<dd>The background for cells used for text editing.</dd>

<dt>Table Cell Background</dt>
<dd>The background for header cells used in tables of data.</dd>

</dl>


<h2><a name="variables"></a>Format-Specific Variables</h2>

<p>To change format-specific variables, open the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences window and click on the &quot;Editing&quot; tab. The margin settings and default settings are common to all formats. The variables specific to the &quot;Default Format&quot; are:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Thumbnails Per Row</dt>
<dd>Links for records to multimedia objects are displayed with a thumbnail image to the object. This preference sets the number of thumbnails per row in the display. The thumbnails will also adjust in size if the window size is changed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speed up display of thumbnails, GEDitCOM II generates small thumbnails for each multimedia object containing an image. These thumbnails look fine when the links are small. If the links get large (<i>e.g.</i>, when using one thumbnail per row), this format will use the full scale image rather than the internal thumbnails. The image quality will be good, but it might slow down access to records with lots of linked images. To maximize speed when opening such records, it is best to increase this setting to at least 2 and you may need 3 or more if using a large monitor with large record windows.
</dd>

<dt>Notes Position</dt>
<dd>The position for the text editing pane in Notes records. The options are: left, top, right, and bottom (case insensitive).
</dd>

<dt>Chart Box Width</dt>
<dd>The width of cells in the pedigree chart. Make it large enough for your longest names.
</dd>

<dt>Chart Column Spacing</dt>
<dd>The horizontal spacing between generations in the pedigree chart</dd>

<dt>Chart Row Spacing</dt>
<dd>The vertical spacing between spouses in the pedigree chart</dd>

<dt>Chart Box Padding</dt>
<dd>Extra padding within the cell in the horizontal direction</dd>

<dt>Ancestors Indicator</dt>
<dd>This string (of any length) is placed after links to spouses and parents who have documented ancestors (at least parents are known)</dd>

<dt>Descendants Indicator</dt>
<dd>This string (of any length) is placed before links to children who have documented descendants (at least their children are known)</dd>

<dt>Spouse Indicator<dt>
<dd>This string (of any length) is placed before links to children who have no known children, but do have a known spouse.</dd>
