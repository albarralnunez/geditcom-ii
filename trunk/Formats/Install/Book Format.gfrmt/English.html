<p>This format displays the text is a very printer-friendly way. You can edit many parts of the data, but it has fewer editing options than the &quot;Default Format&quot;.
</p>

<p>All data is loaded into a single window without the use of separate panes or subordinate windows. In fact even linked data (such as notes and multimedia objects) are all loaded into the same window as well (note: notes on records will appear as links when viewed, but the entire text of the notes will show up when the record is printed). While this approach is desirable for printing the entire content of records, it can result in long displays. When viewing very long records, you may even notice a slight delay while all the data is formatted for display.
</p>

<h2>Book Format Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>Although there do not appear to be any editing fields, much of the text can be edited. Click the mouse in any text to see if editing is allowed. If you get a flashing cursor, you can edit the text.</li>

<li>You can drag and drop records on records to attach data as explained in the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> help.
</li>

<li>You change the format's fonts (and their colors) using the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences. The available fonts are:
<ul>

<li><b>Section Label</b>: Text used for major sections of the record data.

<li><b>Label Text</b>: Prominent labels for genealogy data.

<li><b>Static Text</b>: Lower-level text labels.

<li><b>Editing Text</b>: The text used in editing fields.

<li><b>Button Text</b>: The text for buttons.

<li><b>Check Box Text</b>: The text next to check boxes.

<li><b>Popup Menu Text</b>: The text used in pop-up menus.

<li><b>Hyperlink Text</b>: The text used for clickable links between records.

</ul>
</li>

<li>You change the format's colors using the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences.
The available colors are:

<ul>

<li><b>Window Background</b>: Background color of the window (white is best for printing)

<li><b>Editing Background</b>: Background color of editing fields (matching the window background color is best for printing).

<li>Font Colors: You can change color of each font defined above when editing those fonts.

</ul>

</li>

<li>The custom options in the &quot;Editing&quot; section of the <b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences are:

<ul>

<li><b>Section Label's Left Margin</b>: Set the left margin for the section labels within each record.
</li>

<li><b>Level Indentation</b>: Subordinate data is indented further from the root level data. Use this setting to select the indentation per level.
</li>

<li><b>Vertical Shift of Edit Field Labels</b>: Extra shift added to all labels before text editing fields. It is normally 0, but might need to be different. If you change fonts and the labels and the text fields do not line up well, adjust this value to realign them; positive shifts the label down while negative shifts it up.
</li>

<li><b>Vertical Shift of Button Labels</b>: Extra shaft added to all labels before buttons and popup menus. It is normally 0, but might need to be different. If you change fonts and the labels and buttons do not line up well, adjust this value to realign them; positive shifts the label down while negative shifts it up.
</li>

<li><b>Thumbnails Per Row</b>: Linked multimedia objects are displayed as thumbnails in the linking record. This option determines the number of thumbnails per row in the display and thus can be used to control the size of the thumbnail images. You can also control the size by opening the multimedia record for the object and using the scale menu to set a scaling factor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spped up display of thumbnails, GEDitCOM II generates small thumbnails for each multimedia object containing an image. This format will use those thumbnails if this setting is 2 or higher, but if the setting is 1, the link will use the full-scale image instead. The use of full-scale images will give high-quality images suitable for printing, but will slow access to records linked to many large images. To maximize speed when opening such records, it is best set this option to 2 or higher.
</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<h2><a name="languages"></a>Languages</h2>

<p>To choose the language for this user interface, open the &quot;Editing&quot; tab of the<b>GEDitCOM II</b> preferences and select language from the pop-up menu. The options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>Swedish - provided by Bengt Emgård</li>
</ul>

<p>These settings change the langauge in the record browsing windows, but do not change other elements of <b>GEDitCOM II</b> such as menus, sheets, and documentation.</p>
