<p>This format is designed for printing charts of individuals, families, research logs, and notes. These charts provide a concise way to document basic information on your genealogy records. This format has only minimal editing capabilities (for birth, death, and marriage dates and places). For records not support with a chart option (<i>e.g.</i> multimedia and sources), this format has no editing or display functions.

<h1><a name="records"></a>Records Display</h1>

<h2>Individual Records</h2>

<p>Individuals are displayed as a three generation pedigree chart. This chart shows the individual and their spouses, parents, grand parents, and great grandparents. Each ancestor lists their vital information. The main individual in the chart has fields for editing the vital information.
</p>

<p>You can click any name to open that person's pedigree chart. To navigate to children, use the &quot;Children&quot; command in the &quot;View&quot; menu (or click the children icon in the tool bar). To view families with spouses, click the &quot;Family&quot; links under the spouse's name.</p>

<p>The chart will resize as you resize the window, but when printing, it will be fit to a single page. If you resize wider than a page, a red line will appear at the current page boundary. If you resize until the red line just disappears, you will see how the chart will print. When printing, the editing fields will display as simple text rather than framed fields. If the chart is to too cramped in display or when printing, use the &quot;Page Setup...&quot; command to decrease the print margins.
</p>

<h2>Family Records</h2>

<p>Families display as a chart that shows the husband and wife, their marriage details, and each child in the family. The chart width is equal to the current printing page width. It will print to one or more pages as a summary of that family.</p>

<p>You can click any name in the chart to open that person's pedigree chart. To navigate to families for the children, use the &quot;Families&quot; command in the &quot;View&quot; menu (or click the families icon in the tool bar).

<h2>Research Log Records</h2>

<p>Research log records will display and print as a complete display of the information in the log. These charts are useful for printing when traveling (<i>e.g.</i> to a family history library) and you would like a hard copy of research plans. You can click the &quot;Edit&quot; button to edit the summaries in the research log.</p>

<h2>Notes Records</h2>

<p>Notes records will display and print a title and the complete text of the notes. You can click the &quot;Edit&quot; button to edit the notes.</o>
