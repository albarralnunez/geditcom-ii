(*	Descendants Outline to Word
	GEDitCOM II Apple Script
	26 Dec 2009, by John A. Nairn

	Find any number of generations of descendants of the currently
	selected individual (or spouse in a family) and output them in a
	concise outline. The outline will list birth, death, and marriage
	dates if known and will show each person's sex. Spouses are
	included with a "+" sign in front.
	
	The report is output to a Pages document. For other options
	with the same report see:
	   Descendants Outline Report
	   Descendants Outline to Word
		
	To customize the output, edit the AddIndividualDetails()
	method and add any details you want for the report.
