(*	Ancestors Outline Report Script
	GEDitCOM II Apple Script
	9 Dec 2009, by John A. Nairn

	Find any number of generations of ancestors of the currently
	selected individual (or spouse in a family) and output them in a
	concise outline. The outline will list birth, death, and marriage
	dates if known and will show each person's sex.
		
	The report is output to a GEDitCOM II report, which can
	be saved as an html file. For other options with the same
	report see:
	   Ancestors Outline to Pages
	   Ancestors Outline to Word
	   
	TO customize the output, edit the AddIndividualDetails()
	method and add any details you want for the report.
