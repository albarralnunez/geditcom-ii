(*	Descendants Outline Report Script
	GEDitCOM II Apple Script
	29 Nov 2009, by John A. Nairn

	Find any number of generations of descendants of the currently
	selected individual (or spouse in a family) and output them in a
	concise outline. The outline will list birth, death, and marriage
	dates if known and will show each person's sex. Spouses are
	included with a "+" sign in front.
	
	The report is output to a GEDitCOM II report, which can
	be saved as an html file. For other options with the same
	report see:
	   Descendants Outline to Pages
	   Descendants Outline to Word

	To customize the output, edit the AddIndividualDetails()
	method and add any details you want for the report.
