(*	 Report 'ˆ la brother ƒloi-GŽrard Talbot' Script
	GEDitCOM II Apple Script
	11 Dec 2009, by John A. Nairn, adapted March 2011 by StŽphane Lelaure to make it a "Talbot" report.

	Find any number of generations of descendants of the currently
	selected individual (or spouse in a family) and output them grouped
	by generation number. Read the output to understand how the Talbot number system works.
	
	Blue links link to the record. Green links show duplicate individuals.
	
	The report is output to GEDitCOM II report. This report also exists with output to LaTeX.
