(*	Ancestors Outline to Word Script
	GEDitCOM II Apple Script
	26 Dec 2009, by John A. Nairn

	Find any number of generations of ancestors of the currently
	selected individual (or spouse in a family) and output them in a
	concise outline. The outline will list birth, death, and marriage
	dates if known and will show each person's sex.
	
	The report is output to an MS Word document. For other options
	with the same report see:
	   Ancestors Outline Script
	   Ancestors Outline to Pages
		
	To customize the output, edit the AddIndividualDetails()
	method and add any details you want for the report.
